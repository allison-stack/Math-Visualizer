# Introducing... IntegraGraphVisual!
  
The concept of integration can be confusing for most students (especially for those who are learning it for the first time) after all, it's a relatively more advanced concept that builds upon one's understanding of derivatives. To simplify integration, we decided to create a tool that would visualize the integration process -- IntegraGraphVisual.  
  
IntegraGraphVisual is an integral graphing calculator designed to help undergraduate university students in introductory calculus courses visualize the integration process. This tool uses the concept of Riemann sum approximation which approximates an integral by a finite sum and provides a means of visualizing how integration actually works (since to integrate is to find the area under a function).

### Prototype 1:  
#### What we had in mind was a simple-to-use user interface similar to Symbolab. Special symbols would be available for our users to input a function that they wish to see integrated and visualized (using the Riemann sum approximation method).

### Prototype 2:  
#### For this prototype, we wanted to design a more aesthetically pleasing user interface and add an additional function that would allow users to see what mathematical steps were involved alongside the Riemann sum approximation visualization.

### Prototype 3:  
#### We stuck to recreating prototype two mockups in Elm, adding in color and implementing the _Definitions_ page as well as the _About_ page.

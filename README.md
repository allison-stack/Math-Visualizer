# Introducing... IntegraGraphVisual!
  
The concept of integration can be confusing for most students (especially for those who are learning it for the first time) after all, it's a relatively more advanced concept that builds upon one's understanding of derivatives. To simplify integration, we decided to create a tool that would visualize the integration process -- IntegraGraphVisual.  
  
IntegraGraphVisual is an integral graphing calculator designed to help undergraduate university students in introductory calculus courses visualize the integration process. This tool uses the concept of Riemann sum approximation which approximates an integral by a finite sum and provides a means of visualizing how integration actually works (since to integrate is to find the area under a function).

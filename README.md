# Introducing... IntegraGraphVisual!
Integration can be confusing for most students (especially for those who are learning it for the first time) since it is a relatively more advanced concept that builds upon one's understanding of derivatives. Tto make the concept of integration simpler to understand, we decided to create a tool that would visualize the process of integration -- IntegraGraphVisual.
.
IntegraGraphVisual is an integral graphing calculator designed to help undergraduate university students enrolled in introductory calculus courses visualize the process of integration.
